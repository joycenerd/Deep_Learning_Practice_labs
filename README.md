# Deep_Learning_Practice_labs
Labs for 5003 Deep Learning Practice course in summer term 2021 at NYCU.

## Back-propagation 

Understand and implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backward propagation using only two hidden layers.
* Linear data accuracy: 99%
* XOR data accuracy: 100%

## EEG Classification

Implementing two EEG classification model which are EEGNet and DeepConvNet. Also, we are changing the activation function (ELU, ReLU, LeakyReLU) in the model and see the difference.

* EEGNet accuracy: 87.87%
* DeepConvNet accuracy: 76.48%
